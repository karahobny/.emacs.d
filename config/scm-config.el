;;; scm-config.el --- scheme-related configuration
;;; Commentary:
;;;            There really is no need for much configuration when
;;;            it comes to scheme-lang, since it is widely supported
;;;            by default in Emacs.

;;; Code:
(use-package geiser
  :defer t)

(provide 'scm-config)
;;; scm-config.el ends here
